`learnshot` is a screenshot API built for fun and [sharing my experience](https://screenshotone.com/blog/building-screenshot-api/) of building [ScreenshotOne](https://screenshotone.com/). 

## Play with it

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

```
open http://localhost:3000/screenshot?url=https://example.com
```
